# odin-recipies

This is my first project for The Odin Project.

Prior to ths, I've had a solid background knowledge of using HTML & CSS, and also a bit of JS, so doin this project wasn't at all tough for me; only the parts that has to do with copying and pasting text, lol :-)

As at the time of making this commit, i'd pushed the files containing all recipies pages (3) linked to the homepage (index) which all have their respective images, description, header texts, ingredients and steps to preparing each recipe, as instructed for the project.
